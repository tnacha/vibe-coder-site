            <h1>Hi, I’m Tanacha.</h1>
            <p class="tagline">I’m not a programmer by trade — I’m a code explorer. My first steps into coding have been through Vibe Coding, an approach that lets me build through conversation, iteration, and curiosity.</p>
            <p>My background is in information design, user experience, and learning operations, where I’ve spent my career shaping how people learn and interact with technology. Vibe Coding excites me because it blends creativity with accessibility, opening doors for people like me to experiment, build, and share without the traditional barriers.</p>
            <p>This site is where I’ll share my early projects, experiments, and reflections as I continue this journey.</p>
